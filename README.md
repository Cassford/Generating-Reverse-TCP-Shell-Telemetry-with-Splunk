# Generating-Reverse-TCP-Shell-Telemetry-with-Splunk

## Objective

The purpose of this project was to generate telemetery in Splunk using Sysmon and a reverse tcp shell payload
### Skills Learned

- Generating granular telemetry with Splunk and Sysmon for enhanced threat detection.
- Ability to regconize weak or inefficient controls.
- Enhanced knowledge of security vulnerabilities.
- Generic firewall configurations that often allow outbound connections while restricting incoming connections leave host vulnerable to 
  this payload as the payload initiates an outbound connection from the host.
- 

### Tools Used

#### Splunk
###  Sysmon
###  Metasploit
